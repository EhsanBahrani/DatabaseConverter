# DatabaseConverter
Converts Microsoft access database (.accdb) files to SQLite3 database (.db) files.

## Setup
This requires the 64-bit Microsoft Access driver is installed. If it is not already installed, it can be downloaded [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/confirmation.aspx?id=13255). The application has not been tested with the 32-bit driver.

## Usage
Move the executable (and .dll files) into a directory containing Microsoft access database files, and run the executable.
